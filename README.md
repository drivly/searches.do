# worker.templates.do - Cloudflare Worker Project Template

## Getting Started

If you don't already have a browser extension to pretty-print JSON and make links clickable, start by installing that: <https://extensions.do>

Then you interactively use the API at: <https://worker.templates.do/api>

```json

  "api": {
